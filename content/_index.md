## About me

I'm a web developer working with the [Jamstack](https://jamstack.org/) approach. I am one of the maintainers of [Decap CMS](https://decapcms.org/) and I work at [PM TechHub](https://techhub.p-m.si/), a digital agency.

I play guitar at death metal band [Armaroth](https://armaroth.bandcamp.com/), and I do outdoor sports, especially trail running.
